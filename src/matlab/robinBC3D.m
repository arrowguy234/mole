function BC = robinBC3D(k, m, dx, n, dy, o, dz, a, b)
% Returns a three-dimensional mimetic boundary operator that 
% imposes a boundary condition of Robin's type
%
% Parameters:
%                k : Order of accuracy
%                m : Number of cells along x-axis
%               dx : Step size along x-axis
%                n : Number of cells along y-axis
%               dy : Step size along y-axis
%                o : Number of cells along z-axis
%               dz : Step size along z-axis
%                a : Dirichlet Coefficient
%                b : Neumann Coefficient
